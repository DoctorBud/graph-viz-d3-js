Graphviz *dot* in your browser
==============================
Repository graph-viz-d3-js contains code editor and live preview of code.

Features
--------
* Code editor with syntax highlighting and error annotations
* Sneak live preview of dot graph in SVG

Design
------
Editor is based on [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) and syntax highlighting uses its default `mode/dot`.
Error annotations are generated by parser written in [PEG.js](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs).

[Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) is embedded in browser using [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js).
Instead of using SVG directly it uses `xdot` format and parses it. Data structure on the output is drawn using
[d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) with nice animations during coding.

Roadmap
-------
* Test suite using Graphviz gallery examples
* Add code completion for `dot` source editor
* Improve animations with path tweening and concatenation of arrow heads with arrow arcs
* Move `dot` parsing to Ace WebWorker
* Move `viz.js` and `xdot` parsing to separate WebWorker
* Custom `viz.js` compile with `xdot` output only to optimize size
