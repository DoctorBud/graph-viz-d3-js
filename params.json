{"name":"Graphviz in your browser","tagline":"","body":"Graphviz in your browser\r\n==============================\r\nRepository graph-viz-d3-js contains code editor and live preview of code.\r\nCheck out editor live [demo](http://mstefaniuk.github.io/graph-viz-d3-js/demo/index.html).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n* Code editor with syntax highlighting and error annotations\r\n* Sneak live preview of dot graph in SVG\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n------\r\nEditor is based on [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) and syntax highlighting uses its default `mode/dot`.\r\nError annotations are generated by parser written in [PEG.js](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs).\r\n\r\n[Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) is embedded in browser using [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js).\r\nInstead of using SVG directly it uses `xdot` format and parses it. Data structure on the output is drawn using\r\n[d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) with nice animations during coding.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n* Test suite using Graphviz gallery examples\r\n* Add code completion for `dot` source editor\r\n* Improve animations with path tweening and concatenation of arrow heads with arrow arcs\r\n* Move `dot` parsing to Ace WebWorker\r\n* Move `viz.js` and `xdot` parsing to separate WebWorker\r\n* Custom `viz.js` compile with `xdot` output only to optimize size\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCurrently project is available on LGPL so you can use it unmodified in open and commercial projects. If you add improvements\r\nto it you must share them.\r\n","google":"UA-46840650-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
